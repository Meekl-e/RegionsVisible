# This file only example, so I don't use color codes

spawn: # name of yours region as a WorldGuard
  world: "world" # world of the region
  name: "Territory of spawn" # name in the action bar

# You can remove __global__s regions and plugin will be show only special regions (other regions in file and homes)
# Or you can set enabled: false in the config and disable all regions
# BUT if in the config

__global__|world: # __global__ region of world
  name: "World free region" #name in ActionBar

__global__|world_nether: # __global__ region of world_nether
  name: "World nether free region" #name in ActionBar

__global__|world_the_end: # __global__ region of world_the_end
  name: "world the end free region" #name in ActionBar

# When plugin enabling - it searches world and create __global__ region for it
